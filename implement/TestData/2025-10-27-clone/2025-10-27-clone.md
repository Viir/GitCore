# 2025-10-27-clone

Used the following command, while the repository was on commit `14eb05f5beac67cdf2a229394baa626338a3d92e`:

```txt
git  clone  --progress  --verbose  https://github.com/Viir/GitCore.git
```

The git CLI then output the following:

```txt
Cloning into 'GitCore'...

```

The directory `files-after-git-clone` contains the files found in the `.git` directory after this clone, minus the `hooks` directory.
